<p align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Microsoft is perhaps the most hated company in the history of business. Anointed with names such as the Redmond Giant, Microshaft, Microsloth, so on and so forth, the nicknames and jokes are perhaps exceeded only by the vengeance with which people hate it. </font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">The question is why do they? I love Microsoft. Absolutely adore it and what’s more, I hate Linux. I think it’s the most over rated piece of software ever built and survives simply out of spite and not because it is terribly good at doing something because it is not!</font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">What has Microsoft given us? It has given us Windows, sure, it was buggy earlier and a lot of things didn’t work like they were supposed to (plug and play springs to mind) but it was a pioneering effort. No one was even close to the ease of use that Windows offered. Sure, Mac OS was a lot prettier but then it cost the moon and the stars along with both your arms and legs.</font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">I understand the criticisms about the security of the software, the critical flaws and what not but again, we must look at things in the proper perspective. More than 95 pecent computers in the world use one form of Windows OS or another. The remaining being divided between Linux, Mac etc. now lets say MAC has 1 percent, does it make sense for a hacker to create a virus that can at best infect just 1 percent of the computers in the world? It doesn’t, therefore you don’t have as many security threats for other software as most of the people developing Linux probably sit at night writing up malicious code for windows!</font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">In a nutshell, it’s not so much as that the software is secure; it’s simply that no one is interested in spending sleepless nights writing a virus that won’t give them the satisfaction they get from causing havoc. Considering the fact that everyone who knows how to write two bits of code dreams of hitting windows with a virus, the guys at the "Redmond Giant" are doing a spectacular job.</font></p> <p align="justify"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">XP is such a joy when it comes to simply connecting a device and watching the pretty little bubble detecting it and saying "its installed and ready for use" makes the slightly high price absolutely worth it. In Linux, you have to recompile a kernel if you want to so much as change your modem! Give me a break guys, Linux is light years behind Windows XP and I am sure it will be further back biting the dust when Longhorn (now Vista) comes out. </font> <p align="justify">Source: <a href="http://www.cooltechzone.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1645">CoolTechZone</a> <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> <hr> My Comments: Sometimes funny, but I can't agree with that.</font>
